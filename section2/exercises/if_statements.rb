# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section2/exercises/if_statements.rb`

# Example: Using the weather variable below, write code that decides
# what you should take with you based on the following conditions:
  # if it is sunny, print "sunscreen"
  # if it is rainy, print "umbrella"
  # if it is snowy, print "coat"
  # if it is icy, print "yak traks"

  weather = 'icy'

  if weather == 'sunny'
    p "sunscreen"
  elsif weather == 'rainy'
    p "umbrella"
  elsif weather == 'snowy'
    p "coat"
  elsif weather == 'icy'
    p "yak traks"
  else
    p "good to go!"
  end

# Experiment with manipulating the value held in variable 'weather'
# to print something other than 'coat'

# Using the num_quarters variable defined below, determine
# if you have enough money to buy a gumball. A gumball costs
# two quarters.

# Right now, the program will print
# out both "I have enough money for a gumball" and
# "I don't have enough money for a gumball". Write a
# conditional statement that prints only one or the other.

# Experiment with manipulating the value held within num_quarters
# to make sure both conditions can be achieved.

gumball_quarter_worth = 2
current_num_quarters = 1

if current_num_quarters >= gumball_quarter_worth

# Using the variables defined below, write code that will tell you
# if you have the ingredients to make a pizza. A pizza requires
# at least two cups of flour and sauce.

# You should be able to change the variables to achieve the following outputs:
# If cups_of_flour = 1 and has_sauce = true, print "I cannot make pizza"
# If cups_of_flour = 5 and has_sauce = false, print "I cannot make pizza"
# If cups_of_flour = 2 and has_sauce = true, print "I can make pizza"
# If cups_of_flour = 3 and has_sauce = true, print "I can make pizza"

# Experiment with manipulating the value held within both variables
# to make sure all above conditions output what you expect.

# ensuring we have atleast two cups of flour and 2 cups of sauce to make pizza as per line 57
# since we are not specifically discussing garlic cheese sticks, sauce must be present to make pizza
cups_of_flour = 3
cups_of_sauce = 2
has_sauce = true

# if we have no sauce, ruby prints that we cannot make pizza right away
if has_sauce == true
  if cups_of_flour >= 2 && cups_of_sauce >= 2
    puts "I can make Pizza."
  else
    puts "I cannot make Pizza."
  end
else
  puts "No SAUCE!? No Pizza. I cannot make Pizza."
